## This repository contains computer vision Laboratory Experiments:

Use any one of the OpenCV/Scikit-Image library in C++/Python to perform following experiments:

1.	WAP to open the webcam, capture an image, print the number of pixels in the image and save the image in JPG and PNG format. 

2.	WAP to open a JPG Image File and perform following operations on the image without using any corresponding library functions:
a.	Scaling
b.	Rotation
c.	Flipping

3.	WAP to build a GUI to adjust following parameters on a webcam image using corresponding library functions: 
a.	Contrast 
b.	Brightness
c.	Sharpness
d.	Hue
e.	Saturation

4.	WAP to perform High Pass & Low Pass Filtering operations (in Fourier Domain) on a JPG image file and save it.

5.	WAP to draw Histogram of an input image before and after performing Histogram Equalization. 

6.	WAP to open any medical image file (MRI/CT/PET scan) and perform edge detection on it. 

7.	WAP to identify a shape (for e.g. circle, line, square, rectangle) in an input image. 

8.	WAP to add a watermark on an input image and later remove it using inpainting. 

9.	Mini Project 1: Take an image of any printed text (for e.g. from a book) as input. Output image of individual characters as separate images. Save each row of the input text image in separately numbered folders. 

10.	Mini Project 2: Use any inbuilt feature extractor for any real-world-object recognition task (for e.g. face recognition). You may use any suitable ML classifier for the task.
